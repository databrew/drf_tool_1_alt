## Installing R libraries

For example

install.packages('ggplot2')

# To use the libraries functions use this code everytime you run the app
library(ggplot2)

```

## Cloning the app to your local computer

- The URL to the github repository is `https://github.com/databrew/drf_tool_1_alt`
- This can be done with in a "point and click manner" using github.com and/or rstudio. 
- To clone via the terminal, simply open up a terminal (after installing git) and type `git clone https://github.com/databrew/drf_tool_1_alt`

## Running the app

- Open up app.R using RStuido (or the terminal) in the same directory (folder) you cloned the app to. 
- If you do not have the libaries installed, the app won't run. Follow the instructions above to install each library.
- Once installed, click on the "Run app" button in the top right hand side of app.R.
