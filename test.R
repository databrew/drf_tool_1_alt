# script to test new implementations: (1) correct severity frequency analsysi with bernoulli and poisson, (2) confidence intervals using an R package, 
# (3) implementing detrending test and detrending function using GAD method (test for residual diff with t test, implement with their method)

# severity freq function for bernoulli

# severity freq function for poisson

# trend test

# detrend function
